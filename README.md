- Hi, I’m @krauth-technology-Hitschler<br/>
meanwhile I'm retired but still part time employed with krauth technology GmbH (www.krauth-technology.de). 

- Beside working on interface data definitions and structures related to public transport I'm a "hobbyist" fan of the simplicity and power of Python. 
It seems that Python and its infrastructure are without limits - yes the "Batteries are built in".

- If my grandchildren will give me the time I work on some more private projects for home automation data aquisition from the hardware level up to Web frontends.

- Currently I'm learning Javascript and Vue.js. Compared to Python some paradigms of Javascript are very much different but without alternative for Web frontends and takes getting used.
